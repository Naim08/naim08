# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Naim

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Product Manager and FullStack Engineer, passionate about telemedicine, ed-tech, and creating impactful software solutions that enhance end-user experiences.

## 🚀 About Me

🎮 My journey into technology was kindled by competitive gaming, where my curiosity led me to explore the world of coding, subsequently blossoming into a robust career in computer science.

🔧 With a technology stack that includes Python, Flask, Django, JavaScript, Reactjs/Redux, SQL, and more, I’ve contributed to various projects at renowned firms like OriginX, AppLovin, Facebook - Oculus Rift, and Johnson & Johnson.

📊 I specialize in data-driven decision-making, leveraging predictive and statistical modeling to drive ROI and increase annual recurring revenue in the ventures I’m involved with.

🌐 My interests extend to telemedicine and ed-tech, where I explore how software can directly and significantly impact end-users in these domains.

🌱 Mentorship and knowledge sharing are close to my heart. I've set up afterschool programs and mentored undergraduates in computer science, always looking to share knowledge and learn from the upcoming generation.
